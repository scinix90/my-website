    <h1>Superhero</h1>
    <p>
        Ok. A <strong>superhero</strong> <em>(sometimes rendered super-hero or super hero)</em> is a type of heroic stock character
        who possesses supernatural or superhuman powers and who is dedicated to fighting crime, protecting the public, and
        usually battling supervillains. A female <strong>superhero</strong> is sometimes called a <strong>superhero</strong>ine
        (also rendered super-heroine or super heroine), although the word <strong>superhero</strong> is commonly used for
        females also. <strong>superhero</strong> fiction is the genre of fiction that is centered on such characters, especially
        in American comic books since the 1930s.
    </p>
    <p>
        By most definitions, characters do not require actual superhuman powers or phenomena to be deemed <strong>superhero</strong>es.[1][2][3]
        While the Dictionary.com definition of "<strong>superhero</strong>" is "a figure, especially in a comic strip or
        cartoon, endowed with superhuman powers and usually portrayed as fighting evil or crime",<sup>[4]</sup> the longstanding
        Merriam-Webster dictionary gives the definition as "a fictional hero having extraordinary or superhuman powers; also:
        an exceptionally skillful or successful person".[5] Terms such as masked crime fighters, costumed adventurers or
        masked vigilantes are sometimes used to refer to characters such as the Spirit, who may not be explicitly referred
        to as <strong>superhero</strong>es but nevertheless share similar traits.

    </p>
    <p>
        Some <strong>superhero</strong>es use their powers to counter daily crime while also combating threats against humanity
        from supervillains, who are their criminal counterparts. Often at least one of these supervillains will be the <strong>superhero</strong>'s
        archenemy. Some long-running <strong>superhero</strong>es such as Batman, Spider-Man, Superman, Captain America,
        Wonder Woman, Iron Man, the Flash, Wolverine, Green Lantern, and Hulk have a rogues gallery of many villains.

        <h3>Early history</h3>
        <p>
            The word '<strong>superhero</strong>' dates to at least 1917.[6] Antecedents of the archetype include such folkloric
            heroes as Robin Hood, who adventured in distinctive clothing.[7] The 1903 play The Scarlet Pimpernel and its
            spinoffs popularized the idea of a masked avenger and the <strong>superhero</strong> trope of a secret identity.[7]
            Shortly afterward, masked and costumed pulp fiction characters such as Zorro (1919), The Shadow (1930) and comic
            strip heroes, such as the Phantom (1936) began appearing, as did non-costumed characters with super strength,
            including Patoruzú (1928), the comic-strip character Popeye (1929) and novelist Philip Wylie's protagonist Hugo
            Danner (1930).[8] In the 1930s, both trends came together in some of the earliest superpowered costumed heroes
            such as Japan's Ōgon Bat[9][10] (visualized in painted panels used by kamishibai oral storytellers in Japan since
            1931), Mandrake the Magician[11][12][13] (1934), Superman in 1938 and Captain Marvel (1939) at the beginning
            of the Golden Age of Comic Books.
        </p>
        <h3>1940s</h3>
        <p>
            During the 1940s there were many <strong>superhero</strong>es: The Flash, Green Lantern and Blue Beetle debuted
            in this era. This era saw the debut of first known female <strong>superhero</strong>, writer-artist Fletcher
            Hanks's character Fantomah, an ageless ancient Egyptian woman in the modern day who could transform into a skull-faced
            creature with superpowers to fight evil; she debuted in Fiction House's Jungle Comics #2 (Feb. 1940), credited
            to the pseudonymous "Barclay Flagg".[14][15] The Invisible Scarlet O'Neil, a non-costumed character who fought
            crime and wartime saboteurs using the superpower of invisibility created by Russell Stamm, would debut in the
            eponymous syndicated newspaper comic strip a few months later on June 3, 1940.
        </p>
        <p>
            One superpowered character was portrayed as an antiheroine, a rarity for its time: the Black Widow, a costumed emissary of
            Satan who killed evildoers in order to send them to Hell — debuted in Mystic Comics #4 (Aug. 1940), from Timely
            Comics, the 1940s predecessor of Marvel Comics. Most of the other female costumed crime-fighters during this
            era lacked superpowers. Notable characters include The Woman in Red,[17][18] introduced in Standard Comics' Thrilling
            Comics #2 (March 1940); Lady Luck, debuting in the Sunday-newspaper comic-book insert The Spirit Section June
            2, 1940; the comedic character Red Tornado, debuting in All-American Comics #20 (Nov 1940); Miss Fury,[19] debuting
            in the eponymous comic strip by female cartoonist Tarpé Mills on April 6, 1941; the Phantom Lady, introduced
            in Quality Comics Police Comics #1 (Aug. 1941); the Black Cat,[20][21] introduced in Harvey Comics' Pocket Comics
            #1 (also Aug. 1941); and the Black Canary, introduced in Flash Comics #86 (Aug. 1947) as a supporting character.[22]
            The most iconic comic book <strong>superhero</strong>ine, who debuted during the Golden Age, is Wonder
            Woman.[23] Modeled from the myth of the Amazons of Greek mythology, she was created by psychologist William Moulton
            Marston, with help and inspiration from his wife Elizabeth and their mutual lover Olive Byrne.[24][25] Wonder
            Woman's first appearance was in All Star Comics #8 (Dec. 1941), published by All-American Publications, one of
            two companies that would merge to form DC Comics in 1944.

        <h2>Common traits</h2>
        <p>Many <strong>superhero</strong> characters display the following traits:
            <ul style="list-style-type:square">
                <li>Extraordinary powers or abilities. <strong>superhero</strong> powers vary widely; superhuman strength, the
                    ability to fly, enhanced senses, and the projection of energy bolts are all common. Some characters like
                    Batman, Mockingbird, the Phantom and the Question possess no superhuman powers but have mastered skills
                    such as martial arts, espionage techniques, and applied or forensic sciences to a highly remarkable degree.
                    Others rely on fantastical weapons or technology, such as Iron Man's powered armor suits, Green Lantern’s
                    power ring, and trick arrows employed by Green Arrow and Hawkeye. Many characters supplement their innate
                    superhuman powers with a special weapon or device (e.g. Captain America's shield, Wonder Woman's lasso
                    and bracelets, Thor's weather manipulating hammer, and Wolverine's adamantium claws).</li>
                <li>A strong moral code, including a willingness to risk one's own safety in the service of good without expectation
                    of reward. Such a code often includes a refusal or strong reluctance to kill or wield lethal weapons.</li>
            </ul>
